## Git Config
```
git config user.name "user"
git config user.email "email"
```

## Compiling and Running Java Programs
Note that since our classes are separate classes, you will need to compile ALL the files (at least one time).  You can do this by running
```
javac *.java
```
The star means to compile every file that is a Java file type.

Run your code by running
```
java Main
```

After you compile the shape classes, you only need to compile and run `Main.java` as usual.

# Instructions  

## Classwork
### sumArray Method
Complete the `sumArray` method that takes in an array of `double` values and returns the sum of that array.

### averageLength Method
Complete the `averageLength` method, which takes in an array of `String` values as a parameter, and returns the average of the length of the Strings in the array.

### arrayMax Method
Complete the `arrayMax` method, which finds the maximum element of the array.  Assume the array is non-empty.

### linearSearch Method
Complete the `linearSearch` method, which takes in an array of Strings as a parameter as well as a target String, and returns `true` if the target is found, and `false` otherwise.
